This project is a simple light bending simulator created for educational purposes. It refers to the physics chapter called optics in physics, to be more consice, the bending of light, effect of refraction and reflection. Refraction is the bending of light (it also happens with sound, water and other waves) as it passes from one transparent substance into another. 

The refraction of light when it passes from a fast medium to a slow medium bends the light ray toward the normal to the boundary between the two media. In this project three of the most illustrated mediums considered such as air, water and glass.

Using this project I tried to illustrate how Snell's law operate and how light bends in different environments with specific index of refractions.
